            <strong>Proof of stake</strong>
           

            <p>The most common alternative to proof of work is proof of stake.</p>


            <p>
                In this type of consensus algorithm, instead of investing in expensive computer equipment in a race to
                mine blocks, a &apos;validator&apos; invests in the coins of the system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note the term validator. That&apos;s because no coin creation (mining) exists in proof of stake. Instead, all
                the coins exist from day one, and validators (also called stakeholders, because they hold a stake in the
                system) are paid strictly in transaction fees.

            </p>

            <p>
                In proof of stake, your chance of being picked to create the next block depends on the fraction of coins
                in the system you own (or set aside for staking). A validator with 300 coins will be three times as
                likely to be chosen as someone with 100 coins.

            </p>
            
            <p>If the validator tries to double sign or fork the system, those coins are slashed.
